    <h1>Homework 3: Projections</h1>
    <h1>Jacob Concepcion</h1>
    
    <h3 style="color:red">How did you display the map in different projections using QGIS?</h2>
    <p>This assignment involved representing the same data in various different projections through QGIS. 
        This was done by loading in the data as usual, but the projection that we view the data through was manipulated. 
        I used the projection tab towards the bottom right of the QGIS screen to change the projection. 
        The indicatrix plugin was used to create an overlay revealing the distortions that each different projection 
        contributed to. </p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>The WGS84 Projection preserves area, shape, and distance rather well between the poles. At the poles, the shape is somewhat distorted, but the most obvious change is the increased representation of size. This is likely useful for maps of various scales between the poles.</h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3> The Aitoff projection appears to distort the shape and distance at the poles, but protects the area. It looks to be a spherical projection type. This would be useful for maps that prioritize shape.</h3>

    <h2>Pseudo-Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection preserves the shape and direction, as the Mercator projection was intended for navigation purposes. This distorts size to a large degree. Areas near the poles appear larger than in actuality.</h3>

    <h2>Sphere Winkel</h2>
    <h3>The Winkel projection balances the distortion across the board. As a result, the shape, area, and directions all appear to be only slightly distorted. This results in a balanced, visually pleasing map.</h3>

    <h2>World Cylindrical Equal Area</h2>
    <h3>This projection sacrifices shape to preserve the area. Closer to the poles, the shapes stretch out. Since cylindrical projections typically do not protect area, the stretching is even more prominent.</h3>

    <h2>World Equidistant Conic</h2>
    <h3>This projection distorts shape and size the further away from the North Pole that it goes. However, the circular ring around the North Pole, where I assume the tip of the cone would be imagined, preserves shape and size very well. It is also an equidistant map, meaning it preserves distance. This provides a view that we often do not consider, showing just how close Earth's landmasses are.</h3>

    </a>
    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant</h2>
    <h3>This is similar to the previous projection, but it is an azimuthal projection and is now a fully enclosed circle. This has resulted in even more distortion of shape/size further from the poles, while still preserving distance and direction.</h3>

    <h2>Sphere Eckert II</h2>
    <h3>Unlike many other projections in this collection, the Sphere Eckert projection trades off accuracy closer to the equator for more accurate poles. Closer to the poles, the shape is more accurate. It is probably useful for researchers interested in the polar regions. However, it appears to maintain accurate areas across all regions.</h3>

    <h2>Sphere Mollweide</h2>
    <h3>This projection appears to protect area, and slightly distorts the shape and distance closer to the poles. It looks similar to the Winkel projection, but does not preserve shape as well.</h3>

    <h2 style="color:red">Now, you should <u>add the following projections on your own:</u></h2>
    <h3>EPSG: 3857, 53018, 54034, 54027, 102016, and two additional projections that you choose.</h3>
    <p>Completed Above</p>
